#How to call a for loop
#Range starts at 0 and ends at one less than finish
for i in range (10):
  print(i)
#The for loop travels from the first number to one less than the finish.
for i in range (1,11):
  print(i)
#Add up the numbers from 1 to 100 inclusive
x = 0
for i in range (1,101):
    x = x + i
    print (x)
z = 1
while z < 20:
    print ("z= ", z)
    z = z + 1
print ("I'm finished and z = ", z)
